# ===============================================================
# Messages
# ===============================================================
# There are two kinds of messages:  "activity" and "bell"
# They are also the names of the commands that set the
# respective messages.  In every message there can be "meta
# strings" which are replaced by values.  A meta string starts
# with a percent sign and is then followed by one
# of the following letters: aAcCdDfFhHlmMnstuwWyY
# The meta strings usually refer to the current
# date and time or to a window title or number.
# There are also some specials like embedded branches (with %?),
# color codes (with %{xy}) and padding (with %=, %<, %>).
# you can find their description in the manual in section
# "STRING ESCAPES":
#  %%      percent sign (the escape character itself)
#  %a      either 'am' or 'pm' - according to the current time
#  %A      either 'AM' or 'PM' - according to the current time
#  %c      current time HH:MM in 24h format
#  %C      current time HH:MM in 12h format
#  %d      day number - number of current day
#  %D      Day's name - the weekday name of the current day
#  %f      flags of the window
#  %F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus
#  %h      hardstatus of the window
#  %H      hostname of the system
#  %l      current load of the system
#  %m      month number
#  %M      month name
#  %n      window number
#  %s      seconds
#  %t      window title
#  %u      all other users on this window
#  %w      all window numbers and names.
#  %-w     all window numbers up to the current window
#  %+w     all window numbers after the current window
#  %W      all window numbers and names except the current one
#  %y      last two digits of the year number
#  %Y      full year number
#
# Older versions of screen used a single '%' character
# to display window titles - but since version 3.7 this is
# obsoleted by '%n' and it will vanish in future releases.
# So please update your screenrc to meet this convention!
